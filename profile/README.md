# Monistode

Monistode is an organization containing work for the 2023 POC course at UCU.

It contains the implementations of the four educational ISA's developed for showing the difference between the four different
CPU design paradigms, and also the assembler, linker and emulator for the four assembly languages for the ISA's

You can see the emulator [here](https://https://monistode.vercel.app) and the documentation [here.](https://github.com/monistode/ISA-docs)
